Definitions for :
Convolution is the process of filteration on input image that leads to an output with reduced pixels
Filters/Kernels is group of weights that scan the entire input. Based on the weights , features are detected
Epochs indicates the number of times dataset is processed entirely through the neural network
1x1 Convolution maps all input pixels with output channels to output pixels. 
3x3 Convolution reduces the depth of input image by 2 pixels
Feature Maps is the output created by application of a filter on input (previous layer)
Activation Function used for suppressing relevant and un-relevant information from the dataset
Receptive Field is how many field in the end that pixel is seeing
